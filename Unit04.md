**Unit 4: Measurement Concepts** <span id="4"></span> 
*All research measures something and that “something” is a variable.
This unit will provide an in-depth introduction to variables and
approaches to measuring them. Variables are not always as tangible in
psychology as they are in other disciplines (i.e., in psychology, you
may be attempting to measure someone’s happiness, whereas in medicine,
you might be measuring someone’s weight). As such, psychologists have
had to develop certain tools and methodologies in order to accurately
and reliably gather data. In this unit, we will learn the ways in which
psychologists measure their findings and the terms they commonly use to
evaluate the quality of such measurement.*

    between independent and dependent variables. Measurement issues will
    apply to dependent variables.

    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Please read this webpage to learn about levels of
    measurement and measurement scales. Because the different
    measurement scale types will affect the kind of analysis that you
    can do with the data, it is important to be able to identify the
    measurement scale used by a particular study’s dependent variable.
    At the end of this subunit, you should be able to list and define
    the four levels of measurement.  
      
     Reading this webpage should take approximately 30 minutes.

    Values”](http://www.intropsych.com/ch01_psychology_and_science/variables_and_values.html) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Before we can manipulate or measure a variable, we
    must define it. These definitions are in terms of the operations
    performed. So, for measurement, the operational definition specifies
    the operations performed to measure a variable. Please read these
    webpages to learn about operational definitions. At the end of this
    subunit, you should be able to define the term *operational
    definition* and compare and contrast effective and less effective
    operational definitions.  
      
     Reading these webpages should take approximately 30 minutes (about
    10 minutes each).

     Instructions: It is important for measures to be reliable
    (consistent over time). Even though the source for this subunit is
    somewhat technical, please read this webpage for an introduction to
    the concept of reliability. At the end of this subunit, you should
    be able to define the term *reliability* and describe what it means
    for a variable to have low or high reliability.

     Instructions: Even though reliability refers to consistency, there
    are a number of ways for this to be realized. Please read this
    webpage for an overview of the different types of reliability. This
    reading will cover interrater (interobserver) reliability,
    test-retest reliability, parallel-forms reliability, and internal

     Instructions: This subunit serves as a bridge between the concepts
    of reliability and validity. Reliability refers to how consistent a
    measurement is. Validity refers to whether the measurement is
    measuring the thing you think it is measuring. Please read this
    webpage for a review of reliability and validity and the differences
    between them and a discussion of how they are interrelated. At the
    end of this subunit, you should be able to define validity and
    compare and contrast reliability and validity.

    concept of validity. Please read the second two pages for a
    definition of internal and external validity and to gain an
    understanding of what distinguishes internal validity from external
    validity. At the end of this subunit, you should be able to define
    internal validity and external validity. You should also be able to
    distinguish internal from external validity.  
      
     Reading these webpages should take approximately 2 hours (about 1

    instrument is measuring the thing it is intended to measure. Please
    read the above webpage in order to understand the concept of
    construct validity. Please also click the link for “measurement
    validity types” and read that page to learn about the different ways
    to assess construct validity. At the end of this subunit, you should
    be able to define construct validity and identify the main issue in
    assessing construct validity. You should also be able to define face
    validity, predictive validity, concurrent validity, convergent
    validity, and discriminant validity.

    but it is also important to be an educated consumer of research
    produced by others. Please read through the first two sections of
    this webpage (“Problem and Background” and “Factors Jeopardizing
    Internal and External Validity”) for an overview of threats to
    validity. You may stop at “Three Experimental Designs.” At the end
    of this subunit, you should be able to list and define the nine
    threats to internal validity and the four threats to external
    validity. These lists will be helpful as you read research
    reports.  
      
     Reading this webpage should take approximately 30 minutes.
