**Unit 1: An Introduction to Research** <span id="1"></span> 
*Research is the foundation on which any solid science must be built. It
creates an organized and structured way to gain knowledge about a
certain “system” (in research, we refer to the system as “the
variable”). In this unit, we will explore the scientific method and
discuss how it relates to current psychological research. Keep in mind
that this unit will serve as a broad introduction that is relevant to
all areas of science, including social science and psychology.*

**1.1 The Scientific Method** <span id="1.1"></span> 
**1.1.1 Inductive versus Deductive Reasoning** <span id="1.1.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: Research Methods Knowledge Base: William Trochim’s
    “Deduction and Induction”**
    Link: Research Methods Knowledge Base: William Trochim’s [“Deduction
    and Induction”](http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/dedind.php)
    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Please read this webpage in order to understand the
    differences between inductive and deductive reasoning. Our goal in
    psychology research is to understand and predict behavior. These two
    forms of logic (a) make general statements about behavior from the
    data that we collect (induction) and (b) use those general
    statements to predict future behavior (deduction). At the end of
    this reading, you should be able to define induction and deduction
    and to describe the differences between them.  
      
     Reading this webpage should take approximately 30 minutes.

    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Please read pages 1 through 5 of this workshop for an
    overview of the concept of statistical hypothesis testing. Research
    will start with a hypothesis. This is basically your guess about the
    relationship between two things (e.g., if people study more, then
    they will get better grades). The steps in a research project are to
    develop a hypothesis, collect data, and use statistics to evaluate
    those data. This subunit will introduce you to the two statistical
    hypotheses: (1) nothing happened or (2) something happened. At the
    end of this reading, you should be able to define the null and
    alternative hypotheses.  
      
     Completing this workshop should take approximately 1 hour.
