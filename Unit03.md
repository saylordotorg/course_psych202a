**Unit 3: Ethical Research** <span id="3"></span> 
*Research in psychology is integral to helping other human beings; it
enables us to better understand others and their behaviors. However,
researchers must be careful to avoid endangering humans in their
experiments. The methods used in all experiments must be appropriate and
ethically sound. This unit will investigate the importance of the ethics
of the experimenter and the experiment itself and identify certain
safeguards that should be in place to protect the rights of the
experiment’s participants.*

    Psychological Science: Jerry Burger’s “Replicating Milgram”**
    Link: Wikipedia’s [“Milgram
    Experiment”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/PSYCH202A-3.1.1-Milgram-experiment.pdf)

    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Before we go into the details of the ethical rules
    governing psychology research, there is some value in looking at
    research conducted before the ethical guidelines were in place. This
    will be your chance to think about the challenges we face in
    conducting research in psychology. How can we answer important
    questions while simultaneously respecting the rights of
    participants? Please read through the first sections on Wikipedia’s
    “Milgram Experiment” (pages 1–5, through “Ethics”), and Jerry
    Burger’s “Replicating Milgram.” Consider the changes Burger made to
    Milgram’s original experiment and what your opinions are on the
    ethics of the experiments.  
      
     Reading these webpages should take approximately 2 hours and 30
    minutes (about 1 hour and 45 minutes for the first one and 45
    minutes for the second one).
