**Unit 2: The Research Report** <span id="2"></span> 
*The research report is the primary method by which scientists let
others know of their research and findings. Psychologists frequently
find the report a source of debate—they may disagree with theories and
findings it contains and/or their applicability. This unit will
familiarize you with different aspects of the research report and enable
you to read articles in psychology. Learning the different facets of the
research report will prove invaluable when reading other people’s
reports and when conducting your own experiments.*

Research Findings** <span id="2.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: Van Guard University of Southern California: Douglas
    Degelman’s “Literature Search Essentials” and the American
    Psychological Association’s “Library Research in Psychology”**
    Link: Van Guard University of Southern California: Douglas
    Degelman’s [“Literature Search
    Essentials”](http://psychology.vanguard.edu/faculty/douglas-degelman/literature-search-essentials/) (HTML)

    Psychology”](http://www.apa.org/education/undergrad/library-research.aspx) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: The first part of any research project is finding out
    what others have done to address the question that you are asking.
    Locating previous research is a valuable skill. Please read these
    webpages to learn about researching previous findings and the
    process of gathering sources. At the end of this subunit, you should
    be able to identify databases that can be used to search for
    psychology research. You should also be able to modify your search
    terms to narrow the results to help you locate the specific sources
    that you wish to find.  
      
     Reading these webpages should take approximately 2 hours (about 1
    hour each).

    present the material in a method section (details that make it
    easier for the reader to find the information that is desired), you
    should also understand what goes into the three parts of a method
    section. After you click on this link, you will see a number of
    readings. Please click on “Method Section” in order to download the
    PDF. At the end of this subunit, you should be able to list the
