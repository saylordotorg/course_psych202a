**Unit 6: Understanding Research Results** <span id="6"></span> 
*One of the most important aspects of the research process is
understanding the results that your experiment yields. While this may
seem like an easy (or obvious) task, there are a number of steps you
should follow if you wish to accurately understand and use your results.
This unit we will review the ways in which experimental results should
be tested, interpreted, and understood.  
  
 Most of your results will likely be in the form of statistics. We will
touch upon statistics in this unit, but you needn’t know how to
calculate them. You need only understand what each statistic means and
the concept (or concepts) to which it refers.*
