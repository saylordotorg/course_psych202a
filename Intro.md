This Research Methods course is part one of the two-part Research
Methods series, which also includes the Research Methods Lab course.
Research is the foundation on which any solid science is built. This
course will introduce you to research methodologies frequently used in
the social sciences and especially those used in the field of
psychology. It is important that you are able to not only identify the
techniques used by others but also employ them yourself. The course is
designed to provide you with the foundation you will need to apply
certain techniques in the search for your own answers. The course will
begin with an overview of how research, and its appropriate methodology,
came about in science and, more specifically, psychology. We will then
go over the ABCs of conducting research, learning how to define
“variables” and why they are important. While this course will also
touch upon statistics and their importance, it will not require a
comprehensive knowledge of the subject. The course will conclude with a
section on experiment results and the ways in which experimental design
and statistics can be used to ensure certain results. By the end of this
course, you should understand why research methodology is important in
scientific research, be comfortable reading method and results sections
of journal articles, and understand a range of different research
methods (as well as when to employ each).

### Learning Outcomes

    primary research designs.

### Course Information

Welcome to PSYCH202A. General information on the course and its
requirements can be found below.  
  
 **Peer Review Implementer: **Will Langston  
  
 **Primary Resources: **This course is composed of a range of different
free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following:

-   Cornell University: Professor William Trochim’s [“Research Methods
    Knowledge Base”](http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/index.php)
-   Dr. Christopher L. Heffner’s [“AllPsych
    Online”](http://allpsych.com/)

**Requirements for Completion: **In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
Units 1 to 4 lay the foundation for the design and analysis units (5–6)
that are the heart of research methods. You will also need to complete
the following:  

-   Unit 1 assessment
-   Unit 2 application
-   Unit 3 assessment
-   Unit 4 assessment
-   Unit 5 assessment
-   Unit 6 assessment

Some subunits also have quizzes built into the materials. Completing
these quizzes will improve your understanding and long-term retention of
the material in the course. Note that you will only receive an official
grade on your final exam. However, in order to adequately prepare for
this exam, you will need to work through the assessments and
applications listed above.  
  
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the final exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment: **This course should take you a total of 67 hours to
complete. Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the amount of
time you are expected to spend on each subunit. These should help you
plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at these
time advisories and determine how much time you have over the next few
weeks to complete each unit and then set goals for yourself. For
example, Unit 1 should take you 10 hours. Perhaps you can sit down with
your calendar and decide to complete subunits 1.1 (2 hours) on Monday
night, half of subunit 1.2 (a total of 2 hours) on Tuesday night, and so
forth.
