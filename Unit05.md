**Unit 5: Observation, Survey, and Experimental Research Designs** <span
id="5"></span> 
*Almost all psychological research conducted today falls into one of
three categories: observation, survey, or experimental design. While
these designs do differ in their methods of gaining evidence and
results, all three are used in psychology research. Frequently,
psychologists will use multiple designs to study the same subject in
order to confirm or further the theoretical implications found after
using one of the designs. In this unit, you will learn to identify the
similarities and differences between the designs as well as the
different types of methods at your disposal. We will also identify the
strengths and weaknesses of each design type in order to learn when to
employ which design.*

    Research”](http://www.psywww.com/intropsych/ch01_psychology_and_science/observational_research.html) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Perhaps the simplest research design is the
    observation design. In essence the design is this: just watch people
    and record what they do. However, even this simplicity has an
    underlying complexity. Please read these pages for an introduction
    to observation designs and the types of observation designs. At the
    end of this subunit, you should be able to define the three main
    types of observation research: naturalistic observation, participant
    observation, and controlled (structured) observation. You should
    also be able to identify the advantages and disadvantages of each.
    Note that these readings cover the material you need to know for
    subunits 5.1.1–5.1.4.  
      
     Reading these webpages should take approximately 1 hour (about 30
    minutes each).

*Note: This subunit is covered by the readings assigned beneath subunit
5.1.1. For this subunit, you should be learning the properties of
controlled observation, the strengths and weaknesses of this design, and
how it relates to other observation designs. You should also think about
situations in which controlled observation would be the appropriate
design.*

    the heading “Sources of Error in Observation” and read that section
    for a summary of what types of error can arise in observational
    research. At the end of this subunit, you should be able to list and
    define five of the sources of error in observation research.

    sampling, and cluster sampling) and nonprobability sampling
    procedures (haphazard sampling, convenience sampling, and purposive
    sampling). At the end of this subunit, you should be able to compare
    and contrast probability and nonprobability sampling procedures.

    Link: Research Methods Knowledge Base: William Trochim’s [“Survey
    Research”](http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/survey.php) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Sometimes, just watching people will not provide the
    information that we need to address the research question. The basic
    idea behind survey research is this: Just ask people why they do
    what they do. Please read this page for an introduction to survey
    research. You might also click the links for “select the survey
    method,” “construct the survey itself,” “types of questions,”
    “decisions about question content,” “decisions about question
    wording,” “decisions about response format,” and “question placement
    and sequence.” At the end of this subunit, you should be able to
    define survey research.  
      
     Reading this webpage should take approximately 30 minutes.

     Instructions: There are a variety of ways to implement a survey
    research project. Please read these webpages to understand the
    distinction between oral and written surveys and the advantages of
    both. At the end of this subunit, you should be able to compare and
    contrast interview and written survey methods.

**5.4 Experimental Design** <span id="5.4"></span> 
**5.4.1 The Difference between Quasi-Experimental and True Experimental
Design** <span id="5.4.1"></span>

    of Designs”**
    Link: Research Methods Knowledge Base: William Trochim’s [“Types of
    Designs”](http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/destypes.php)
    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: The strongest design type for determining causal
    relationships is the experiment. In this design, you manipulate a
    variable and see what effect it has on another variable. Please read
    this webpage for an overview of different types of designs. This
    reading will help you choose between experimental and
    quasi-experimental designs. Quasi-experimental designs are beyond
    the scope of this course. We will focus on two-group experimental
    designs in the sections that follow. At the end of this subunit, you
    should be able to define what an experiment is.  
      
     Reading this webpage should take approximately 30 minutes.

    [“Experimental
    Design”](http://allpsych.com/researchmethods/trueexperimentaldesign.html) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: The simplest experimental design is the two-group
    design. Within this design type, there are different ways to
    implement the experiment. Please read these webpages for an overview
    of different types of two-group designs. At the end of this subunit,
    you should be able to define the pretest-only design and the
    pretest-posttest design. You should also be able to compare and
    contrast these two designs. Note that these readings will cover the
    material you need to know for subunits 5.4.2–5.4.4.  
      
     Reading these webpages should take approximately 1 hour (about 30
    minutes each).

    to Professor William Trochim for his kind permission to reference
    students to this site.

**5.4.3 Posttest-Only Design** <span id="5.4.3"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the readings assigned beneath subunit
5.4.2. For this subunit, you will learn the properties of the most basic
experimental research design. You will learn how this design addresses
threats to internal validity and allows a causal conclusion to be
drawn.*

**5.4.4 Pretest-Posttest Design** <span id="5.4.4"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the readings assigned beneath subunit
5.4.2. For this subunit, you will learn how adding a pretest to the
posttest-only design increases the strength of the design.*

**5.4.5 Confounding Variables and Internal Validity Revisited** <span
id="5.4.5"></span> 
-   **Reading: Psychology World: Richard Hall’s “Extraneous and
    Confounding Variables and Systematic vs. Non-Systematic Error” and
    Research Methods Knowledge Base: William Trochim’s “Internal
    Validity”**
    Link: Psychology World: Richard Hall’s [“Extraneous and Confounding
    Variables and Systematic vs. Non-Systematic
    Error”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/PSYCH202A-5.3.1-Extraneous-and-Confounding-Variables-and-Systematic-vs-Non1.pdf)
    (PDF) and Research Methods Knowledge Base: William Trochim’s
    [“Internal
    Validity”](http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/intval.php)
    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Internal validity refers to the quality of your
    study. Basically, the better the internal validity, the stronger the
    conclusions that you can draw from the data. Please review these
    webpages to review the concept of internal validity and confounding
    variables. At the end of this subunit, you should be able to define
    confounding variable and identify the primary way we control for
    them in experiments.  
      
     Reading these webpages should take approximately 30 minutes (about
    15 minutes each).

**5.4.6 Complex Experimental Designs: Increasing the Number of the
Independent Variables and/or Increasing the Number of Levels of the
Independent Variable** <span id="5.4.6"></span> 
-   **Reading: Research Methods Knowledge Base: William Trochim’s
    “Factorial Designs”**
    Link: Research Methods Knowledge Base: William Trochim’s [“Factorial
    Designs”](http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/expfact.php)
    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Even though it’s a bit beyond the level of an
    introductory course, the factorial design is an important tool for
    psychologists. This design allows a researcher to manipulate more
    than one variable simultaneously. This acknowledges the fact that
    behavior in the “real world” usually has multiple influences (e.g.,
    think about your reasons for taking this course). Please read this
    webpage for an introduction to factorial designs. At the end of this
    subunit, you should be able to define factorial design.  
      
     Reading this webpage should take approximately 1 hour and 30
    minutes.
